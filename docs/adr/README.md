# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for this project.

ADRs document **important architectural decisions**, including:

- rationale and consequences,
- future considerations.

They help contributors and maintainers understand **why** certain design choices were made and prevent repeated discussions or conflicting changes.
